# UUID-QR-Code-Generator
This Python program automatically generates a UUID string of characters and a QR Code for the UUID.

## How To Use
The first thing to do after downloading the UUIDGen.py file is to install the uuid and qrcode libraries.

```
pip install uuid
pip install pillow
pip install qrcode
```

After the installing is completed, you can replace the default names of people under the `names` variable if you wish (for more personal costomization). Once done, you can finally run the program. Exported by the code are qr code images in png format and a signin.txt file with all the names and the generated UUID passwords.
